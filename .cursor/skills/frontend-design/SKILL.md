# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Instructions

### 1) Design Thinking Before Coding

Understand context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a strong direction and execute it intentionally (minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, pastel, industrial, etc.).
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility, browser support, and project standards.
- **Differentiation**: Define one memorable signature choice that makes the interface stand out.

Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work; intentionality is the key.

### 2) Build Production-Grade UI

Implement working code (NEXT.js in Typescript) that is:
- Functional and maintainable
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear point of view
- Refined in spacing, hierarchy, and interaction details

### 3) Aesthetic Execution Standards

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Prefer characterful, context-specific pairings. Avoid generic defaults and repeated patterns.
- **Color and Theme**: Commit to a cohesive palette with clear hierarchy. Use CSS variables/tokens for consistency.
- **Motion**: Prioritize high-impact moments (entrance choreography, hover behavior, scroll triggers). Use CSS-first motion for static sites and Motion libraries in React when available.
- **Spatial Composition**: Use deliberate asymmetry, overlap, rhythm, density, and negative space.
- **Background and Detail**: Add atmosphere with textures, gradients, overlays, pattern systems, shadows, and visual depth aligned to the chosen direction.

### 4) Avoid Generic Output

Do not produce repetitive, cookie-cutter UI patterns or generic AI aesthetics. Avoid overused font and layout defaults, weak palettes, and predictable hero-card-grid structures unless explicitly required by the user or existing design system.

Vary style direction across requests and adapt to context. Do not converge on the same type, palette, motion language, or composition repeatedly.

### 5) Match Code Complexity to Vision

- Maximalist direction: richer layering, effects, animation systems, and deeper component detail.
- Minimal/refined direction: restraint, precise spacing, subtle contrast, and careful typographic control.

Elegance is execution quality, not feature count.

## Output Expectations

When generating frontend code with this skill:
- Start with a one-paragraph aesthetic direction statement
- Ship complete, runnable code
- Ensure responsive behavior and accessibility basics
- Keep implementation aligned with project conventions
